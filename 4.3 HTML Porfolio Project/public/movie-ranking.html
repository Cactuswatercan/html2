<h1>The best of movies in my opinion By Corrie</h1>
<h2>My top three favorites</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Across the spiderverse</h3>
<p>It was comic like but the different art styles were awesome!</p>
<h3>Knock on the cabin</h3>
<p>It was about how a family would have to decide who would die to save the world</p>
<h3>Avatar way of water</h3>
<p>It was pretty movie but not a lot of action</p>
