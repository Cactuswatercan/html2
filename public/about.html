<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born in 2005. Currently I'm in highschool going into my junior year which I know is going to really diffcult.
  But over the summer I decide to learn how to code. So I could have a backup in life. It's always important to have cards
in your deck.</p>

<p>As I do this I am also an artist but I'm sure where's that going to go. So I turned to this. Imagine that pookie. 
  WD on top and artist on the low. </p>

<p>This isn't funny anymore. I'm tired and I wanna take a nap. Taking about my self isn't my strong suit.
  next question. BARK BARK. 2D character's are better than real people because they can't disappoint you for real for real.
